# website-crawler
### *Vikesh Ajith*

A website crawler based on the python scrapy framework that downloads various document files and videos along with html pages in order to create an offline copy of a website. While it works, several of the variables are hard-coded, so I should get around to creating configuration files if I have further use for the crawler.
